# spotify-analysis
website where you can analyse your spotify library graphically. Hosted at http://spotifish.eu.pythonanywhere.com/

This is a Flask web app which can access a user's spotify account and fetch tracks. At the moment all it does with the tracks is plot audio features against time but I hope to expand the horizons.
